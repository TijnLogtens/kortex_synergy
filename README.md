# Kortex Synergy
This repository constitutes a ROS package and its supporting scripts for connecting the Kinova Gen3 ROS API with the Open Ephys recording platform.
It allows for the real-time acquisition, processing and classification of physiological data into desired changes to the cartesian pose of the Gen3 robotic arm.

This package was built using ROS noetic and python 3.8 and should be included with the corresponding branch of the ros_kortex API to function.
